@article{Kormann:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Current production plants are highly customizable and flexible in their processes. This flexibility is mainly realized by software. It causes an increasing complexity of control software components and the need of new methods for comprehensive and automated testing approaches to ensure a requested level of quality at high efficiency. A survey among mechanical engineering companies of the industries aerospace, automotive and machine/plant automation was conducted. Aspects of requirements engineering, testing, simulation, processes, tools, etc. were addressed to reveal research demands of PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) control software development in machine/plant automation. A system architecture embedding UML sequence diagrams for testing is proposed. We further contribute transformation rules of semantically adapted UML sequence diagrams to the cyclic execution logic of PLCs for reactive systems. The approach can be applied to any IEC 61131-3 programming language of the automation control software. A prototypical realization shows proof of concept and reveals the potential for future work.},

@article{Koch:2019aa,
	Abstract = {Configuration and implementation of safety programs for robot applications have to face the common requirements of changeability and flexibility. The paper points out the challenges for safety and that dynamic reconfiguration and automated compilation of safety programs are not state of the art and not supported by international standards. On the other side HRC technologies and collaborative production scenarios, lead to more required knowledge and a higher complexity in creating safety programs. This paper gives an overview of the state of the art, how safety programs for robot applications are generated and what approaches and methods can be found to automate the program generation. The throughout this paper introduced approach for an automated safety configuration for robot applications is based on the information model of the application. The model consists of product, process, resource and hazard information. Combined with a safety function model and safety standards, it results in a proposed safety state machine as safety program. The throughout this paper introduced safety states are explained by an application example. The safety program is structured by safety states and implemented in a conventional way.},
